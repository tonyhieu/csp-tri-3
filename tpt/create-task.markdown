## Create Task

For my create task, I will be making a basic grade calculator. It will take assignment grades as input and output the final grade. This will use selection (option to remove lowest score), iteration (for loop to add scores and sum them), and sequencing. I can use lists to store the scores (collective data structures). It'll be written in python.
