## Project Idea

My project was to help my golf coach with his blogging website. I want to make it so that it's easier for him to add blog posts and such. Here is the [link to his original site.](https://sdjuniorclub.com) I'm waiting on further instruction on what he wants to add and change to his website, so this will be updated more and more when I get more information.

### 3/25

Here is a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n49aXtYxl_ScfwgDz8NmdqeXN5W3fWsk7BV8Cyrhrvw/edit?usp=sharing) detailing the changes I plan to make.

### Week of 3/14

I contacted my coach about what services he's currently using to run his site. He told me that he's using HostMonster to host and WordPress to display the site. I figure that, since I have a whole trimester to work on it, I can start the website over from scratch and learn new frameworks to add functionality. I've asked for his WordPress account to see how it works and to see if I can gleam any CSS off of it. I've also started research on what kinds of frameworks to use; Nathaniel recommended Gatsby.js for a blog website, and I've considered Jekyll as well. I'll probably end up using Gatsby.js because of the flexibility with creating dynamic pages outside of just a blog.
