## Week One

### TPT 5.1 - Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing

1 - Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

Beneficial: 
- Higher quality of life
- Fast communication
- Cultural and economic globalization

Harmful:
- Invades privacy
- Causes mental illness (particularly social media)
- Breeds extremists through online forums

2 - Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Dopamine issues are real. A lot of the time, students (including me) will spend time playing games, going out, etc. instead of studying which inhibits their ability to learn. I want to learn a lot but I get sidetracked often with video games.

### TPT 5.2 - Digital Divide

1 - How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

People empower themselves through using technology to spread their voice. Nowadays, it's nigh impossible to create a movement using paper based communication, so technology and the internet is necessary to spur change.

2 - How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

Someone that is empowered can use their voice and connections to promote legislation and movements which support giving technology to others. We could create a club dedicated to bridging the digital divide.

3 - Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

I don't know if either of those are blocking digital empowerment. Much legislation, especially in Poway Unified, has gone to give students access to technology, whether it be iPads or Chromebooks. It's more likely that the general public doesn't want to pay taxes to promote these advancements.
