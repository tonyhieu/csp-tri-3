## Week Three

### TPT 5.5 - Legal and Ethical Concerns

- When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.

GNU General Public License: Allows other users to do anything with the GitHub code except for share closed source versions (private, derivative versions). Using this license will waive any patent rights related to the code.

MIT License: Provides more leniency than GNU GPL. No restrictions aside from acknowledging license and copyright notices. Derivative projects don't need to credit source code.

- Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.

I chose the GNU GPL license because I don't think that people would be creating new projects based off of my project. It makes more sense to use a GNU GPL license because it's slightly more restrictive.

### TPT 5.6 - Safe Computing

- Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.

A form of PII that I've seen is the database code. People include some of their personal information on those databases such as names, ages, and phone numbers.

- What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?

I don't really care about it because I think that it is inevitable that my information gets leaked. In fact, there are websites dedicated to scanning public government databases for information on various people. So, it doesn't matter if my PII gets leaked; most of it is public anyways.

- Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.

Good passwords are ones that are unique and difficult to crack. I would argue that a good password is also memorable, so having a password be a special phrase that is unique to you isn't a bad idea. A bad password is something extremely basic and easy to guess; "password1" is way too simple, and other passwords are doomed to the same fate.

- Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.

Symmetric encryption is public and private key encryption. The receiver and sender both have keys and encrypt + decrypt the message at both ends. Asymmetric encryption is where the sender encrypts a message and the receiver decrypts it using one common key.

- Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.

A type of encryption used in deployment is Certbot. Certbot uses encryption to secure a site and turn it from HTTP to HTTPS. This allows both the server and the user to be certain that they are safe from an attack from the other party.

- Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.

I watched a YouTube video to get free items on a video game I played. The video told the viewers to send an email detailing their account details and what items they wanted. I sent my account details, but the owner of the video likely saw my inventory and decided that it wasn't worth hacking. Other phishing techniques include suspicious links or recreating the format of popular sign ins (i.e. imitating a google login).
