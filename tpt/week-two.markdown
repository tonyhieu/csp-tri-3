## Week Two

### TPT 5.3 - Computing Bias

- Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?

The owner of the computer is taking it as a joke and does not think it's intentional. He and his coworker are having a laugh, and the delivery of "Hewlett Packard computers are racist" seems to be more comedic than accusatory. He's also states that it's his "blackness" that's causing the issue, meaning that he thinks that the darker skin tone (instead of any racism) is throwing off the facial tracking software.

- How do you think this happened?

Desi's darker skin complexion is likely harder for the computer to detect, as it can't determine whether it's part of the background or not.

- Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?

It is harmful that members of a certain race cannot fully utilize a technology through no fault of their own. However, the software was likely not intended to be harmful or exclude; rather, the programming was faulty and failed to detect darker people.

- Should it be corrected?

Yes, the error should be corrected, as HP don't want to be labeled as racist or exclusive. 

- What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?

HP could have used more people of color in their sample of machine learning to better track them. This will allow for better facial recognition for people of all races.


### TPT 5.4 - Crowdsourcing

- CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?

A crowdsourcing idea could be a schoolwide website where students can submit their repl.it programs and get/give feedback on them.

- What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

Del Norte crowdsourcing could be effective in an environment where many opinions are needed (i.e. a ratings or recommendation website). My final project would not be better with crowdsourcing, as only 1-2 people are posting blog posts at any given time and doesn't need outside input.
