## MCQ 1

**Question 21**

I knew that the World Wide Web was a collection of web pages and data, but I thought that the internet was a data stream because I thought of it as a way to "connect" to the WWW. Therefore, it "streamed data" onto users computers. In hindsight, interNET has the word for network in it....

**Question 23**

I would argue that someone having your IP address is much more dangerous than someone having your browser cookies. Sure, with browser cookies, someone could access your passwords and such, but with an IP address, someone could kill your internet, brick your computer, find out where you live, and get a plethora of your personal information. In the future, I'll remember that the College Board considers cookies more important to your privacy than your IP address.

## MCQ 2

Perfect score

## MCQ 3

**Question 41**

I didn't know how public key cryptography worked. I knew that you had to use the public key to encrypt the message, but it makes sense that you also use the public, not private, to decrypt it.

## MCQ 4

**Question 1**

I was not reading carefully and thought that the answer I chose said that they could simply identify errors in the programming. I know that users cannot correct errors they encounter; silly mistake.

**Question 3**

I didn't read the question carefully and thought that the first parameter was the the "count" variable, not the second.

**Question 43**

I didn't know what proprietary meant, but now that I understand that it means closed, it makes sense that the Internet does not use closed protocols. I was split between the first option (The Internet is a computer network that uses proprietary communication protocols) and the second, correct option (The Internet is designed to scale to support an increasing number of users).

**Question 48**

I didn't know what a certificate authority was. I thought it was an authority which certifies websites, such as granting sites the https tag. I now understand that these authorities simply verify the authenticity of encryption keys.
